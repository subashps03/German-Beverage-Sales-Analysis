## Insights
+ East and North regions currently lead in sales, followed by West and South.
+ However, West and South have larger populations than East and North.
+ This indicates untapped market potential in the South, particularly due to its lower sales-to-population ratio.
+ Therefore, the South region is recommended as the primary target for the next shop, followed by the West.
+ The most important beverages to stock can be determined from:

## Recommendation
+ To further refine the ideal shop location, we should analyze location-specific population data alongside regional product preferences.
+ We can perform a climate vs. product preference analysis across regions to identify how weather conditions influence beverage choices.
